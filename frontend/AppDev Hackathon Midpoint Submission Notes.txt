Screens to implement:
* Main schedule page
   * Title
   * Screen should start at current time/date and list all future elements/be able to scroll backward too
   * Table View where each row should have:
      * Event name, event time, event location, coordinated background/text color (if repeated)
* Add a new event using push view controller
   * Really just mock creating a calendar event in GCal:
      * Text fields for event name, scroll option to pick time/duration, text field for location (can access location info for suggested locations? Similar to how gcal does it?)
      * Color option, select if it repeats and when (if a class especially)
      * Maybe one more button selecting whether it is a class or another event
   * Finish button that syncs that to database and has it appear on home page
* Could also have present controller used for settings
   * Decide which mode of transportation is being used
   * How often notifications should be delivered
   * Light vs dark node?
   * All of these would just be with ui buttons
* Also could have a present controller for each individual event that just shows a larger screen with all the same info as the table cell - not sure if it’s necessary tbh
For info on why it’s not yet functional, see my Ed Post. XCode simulator was not working properly.
